# Automatic-Directory-Syncer
A python application level program to keep two separate directories synced, similar to Dropbox using low-level socket programming. The program follows a client-server architecture, actively listening to the communication channel for file transfer requests. Files and directories are transferred automatically when updated preserving the file permissions at the source directory. The file transfer incorporates checksum to handle file transfer errors. Occurrences of race conditions are prevented by cross-process file locks. Additionally, a simple, intuitive, and composable command-line interface was developed.
